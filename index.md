# Cheat Sheets for Visualization Techniques

Cheat sheets are sets of _concise graphical and textual explanations_, inspired by infographics, data comics, and cheat sheets in other domains. Cheat sheets aim to support learning, teaching, and the regular use of both common and novel visualization techniques in a variety of contexts. To design cheat sheets for visualization techniques, we describe six components of a cheat sheet: anatomy, build-up, visual patterns, pitfalls, false-friends, variations. We present examples for several visualization techniques, created through an iterative design process which involved data science and visualization teachers, visual designers and students. In a qualitative and iterative user study, we gather subjective feedback from participants, show readability and usefulness of our cheat sheets, and iterated on their design. We bring this together as a design methodology, with a comprehensive design framework to easily create cheat sheets for additional visualizations.

      <td>## Anatomy 
     Anatomy explains the visual elements of a visualization technique, their composition, their specific terminology, and how they relate to the data. The visual components of a visualization can include individual visual marks as well as groups of marks, axes, locations in a visualization etc.
